# Software_Engineering_Shipment_System

This is a course project where we worked as a team to implement a shipment management system.
This project requires Activity 1,2,3 and Activity 1 is the individual work, where we finish implementing about
1/3 of the system functionality by individual.

After activity 1, we use one of our team member's project as skelton to finish 
the remaining system.
During the whole project, I was the commiter named "LIN,Zizheng" in the bitbucket commit history. And I also help write the requirement specification,
use case, UML Diagram.
Originally we use the bitbucket as the version controll tool. In this course, we learnt a lot of software enginnering principle and guidline,
which exposed me to the workflow of software engineer.
After finishing this course's project, I move the repository to this github repository.
